# How I Intend to Generate Interviews

Last week, I posted about my intentions on how I will go about [making money while sleeping](journey). It got about 150 likes on Facebook. For an introvert like me, that's a lot. It probably comes second to my post about Roque being born. It's because I cheated a little and made it about providing for him (and my family).

This post is a little more technical. It contains details on the steps I will take to generate interviews. These interviews will help me rank which industries/businesses will offer the best chances that we'll be able to create a successful, recurring revenue software business.

The manner in which we approach things will change. I want us to change what works and doesn't work in the context that we operate. When I first read *Rich Dad, Poor Dad*, I was certain it would be as easy to do it here. I don't doubt that you can do it. It's not as simple as it is in the US though, because in the Philippines, the rent you can charge is lower than the monthly payments to the bank. That is not to say that I only intend to work with businesses in the Philippines. Software, thanks to the internet, can be made and managed from anywhere.

## Steps

A lot of these are from [PDFs from The Foundation](foundation_pdfs). I tweaked them slightly to take into account the language differences.

1. **Ask your social network**: "Who here owns/runs, or knows someone that owns/runs a small to medium sized business?"
2. **Rank** the responses according to the following:
  - do they already pay for software? If they do, then they are probably comfortable using software and paying for it.
  - how lucrative is the industry? The more profitable, the larger their margins, the more money they'll have to pay for software.
  - do they make P5,000,000 or more per year?
  - do they have a profit-driven mindset? Paying for software is spending to save money. Have profit in mind will let them see this clearly.
  - how many businesses are there in that industry? The more there are, the larger your target market.
  - can they be reached online? This shows they are ready to use online software.
  - can you get in touch with a person that has a pain-point and is a decision-maker? Many time the person you are able to talk to isn't a decision-maker. Don't waste your time.
3. Starting with the business/industry that ranked highest, ask your social network again if they know anyone in the industry
4. Search online (Google) for other companies in the same industry
5. Contact these companies and ask them a set of questions to get to the bottom of their problems.

The next post will be about the questions to ask once you get the list of companies.

Have a great week!

# My Background

I usually introduce myself as a software developer. For most of the money I've made with software, it has been done with trading my time to get money. I go to work at 7 a.m., go home at 4 p.m., and collect a paycheck every month. Software development is quite rewarding in many levels. It is intellectually rewarding, it is engaging, it is challenging, and it doesn't hurt that you can make a decent living.

## Towards Laziness

There is this saying about sofware developers: the good ones are lazy. That's not a description many other fields would see as a compliment, but it is poignantly so for software development.

Why are good software developers lazy? Software is about automation. If there is a task that wastes an hour of a software developer's time per day, then you could be certain that she would look to writing something that automates this process. A software developer must take this to heart to be efficient.

This is where I'd like to take the laziness metaphor further: building a solid and financially secure future for my family in an automated manner. I *could* go to work everyday until I reach the ripe age of 70, assuming I live and I am able to work until then, retire, and finally take those year long trips abroad. I could, but would rather not. I would like go travel while my family is young, while my kids aren't busy, while Trina and I could keep up with them. I will if I have to... but the reality is that I don't have to. Laziness aside, I feel that building a secure future for my family is the morally and financially responsible thing to do. Shall I lose the ability to make money through an accident or a disease, then I have my family covered.

# When It Clicked

The road to this clear realization has been a winding one. Having gone through books like [Rich Dad, Poor Dad](http://www.richdad.com) and [E-Myth](https://emyth.com), I dabbled in non-software and software like businesses. It was, though, with high uncertainty of their success, because I approached it like this:

1. Find an idea
2. Build it
3. Hope that people use it, and when they don't...
4. Market it, and...
5. Hope that it works

I rinsed and repeated, refining the process as I got my hands on other books like [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com). I kept going back to the same pattern though, because for some reason, things didn't click.

It's a good thing that I consume a lot of information though, to help get myself out of my usual way of thinking. Because with one podcast, it finally clicked.

## Dane Maxwell of The Foundation

One podcast I enjoy listening to is [Smart Passive Income](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com). In one of their episodes entitled [Building a Lucrative Business with No Ideas, No Expertise & No Money](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/no-ideas-no-expertise-no-money-business/), I came across a fellow called Dane Maxwell from The Foundation. He says many similar things to The Lean Startup, but his words stuck with me. Dane Maxwell's [formula](http://lp.thefoundation.com/patflynn?afmc=pflynn):

1. Find and validate the idea
2. Sketch a solution
3. Pre-sell the idea
4. Build the product
5. Launch

The difference is deceivingly small, yet it makes sense. Business people say that you must find your market first. I always thought that "finding your market" entailed writing and defining your target market in a business plan, then going out to meet your target market with surveys which they fill up. Who wants to do that? Certainly not the lazy me.

## Jason Cohen of WPEngine

A former officemate of mine, [Ace Subido](http://acesubido.com), shared a [video by Jason Cohen](https://vimeo.com/74338272) with me that further streamlined the process I want to take in bulding software businesses. The key takeaways from the talk (you must watch it though):

1. B2B (Business-to-business)
2. Non-real time
3. Products that can be "finished"
4. Products that fill-in an after-market need

# Automation on Many Levels

My ultimate goal is to automate and streamline the business-creation of these software business. A business that creates businesses. These businesses don't have to be large, multi-million dollar, press-release riddled, and with publicly traded shares - they can be small, solid businesses. [Many small, solid businesses](https://medium.com/entrepreneur-s-handbook/i-sat-down-with-a-millionaire-who-operates-10-businesses-while-sailing-around-the-world-with-his-338929c4e8c9). Then, I could sleep better at night knowing my son will more likely have money for college even when I can no longer get a paycheck.

Comments: From Robert La Quey

I admire the lazy programmer though I have never been one. My puzzle is quite a lot different. I am instead an obcessional programmer, a hard core hacker. You seem to be able to achieve a more balanced perspective than I can. Again I admire that. 

Still I often feel as if I have never had a job. I have always free lanced and worked as a consultant on contracts, usually on a program I proposed because I wanted to do it. I have been a lucky man to survive this way. 

I have treated money like air. You breath in. You breath out. Sometimes you hold your breath. Sometimes you hold your breath longer than you want to. Ok, I will admit it. There have been times I damn near drowned. 

So I can see the appeal of having a more consistent income, LOL.

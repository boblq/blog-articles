# My Background

I usually introduce myself as a software developer. For most of the money I've made with software, it has been done with trading my time to get money. I go to work at 7am, go home at 4pm, and collect a paycheck every month. Software development is quite rewarding in many levels. It is intellectually rewarding, it is engaging, it is challenging, and it doesn't hurt that you can make a decent living.

## Towards Laziness

There is this saying about sofware developers: the good ones are lazy. That's not a description many other fields would see as a compliment, but it is poignantly so for software development.

Why are good software developers lazy? Software is about automation. If there is a task that wastes an hour of a software developer's time per day, then you could be certain that she would look to writing something that automates this process. A software developer must take this to hear to be efficient.

This is where I'd like to take the laziness metaphor further: building a solid and financially secure future for my family in an automated manner. I *could* go to work everyday until I reach the ripe age of 70, assuming I live and I am able to work until then, retire, and finally take those year long trips abroad. I could, but would rather not. I would like go travel while my family is young, while my kids aren't busy, while Trina and I could keep up with them. I will if I have to... but the reality is that I don't have to. Laziness aside, I feel that building a secure future for my family is the morally and financially responsible thing to do. Shall I lose the ability to make money through an accident or a disease, then I have my family covered.

# When It Clicked

The road to this clear realization has been a winding one. Having gone through books like [Rich Dad, Poor Dad](http://www.richdad.com) and [E-Myth](https://emyth.com), I dabbled in non-software and software like businesses. It was, though, with high uncertainty of their success, because I approached it like this:

1. Find an idea
2. Build it
3. Hope that people use it, and when they don't...
4. Market it, and...
5. Hope that it works

I rinsed and repeated, refining the process as I got my hands on other books like [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com). I kept going back to the same pattern though, because for some reason, things didn't click.

It's a good thing that I consume a lot of information though, to help get myself out of my usual way of thinking. Because with one podcast, it finally clicked.

## Dane Maxwell of The Foundation

One podcast I enjoy listening to is [Smart Passive Income](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com). In one of their episodes entitled [Building a Lucrative Business with No Ideas, No Expertise & No Money](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/no-ideas-no-expertise-no-money-business/), I came across a fellow called Dane Maxwell from the foundation. This fellow apparently says many similar things to The Lean Startup, but it stuck with me. I've been doing things mostly right, but with a fundamental difference - I didn't find the customer first. Dane Maxwell's formula:

1. Find the customer/s (they must be willing to give, or have already given you money)
2. Build it

It is deceivingly simple, yet it makes sense. Business people say that you must find your market first. I always thought that "finding your market" entailed writing and defining your target market in a business plan, then going out to meet your target market with surveys which they fill up. Who wants to do that? Certainly not the lazy me.

## Jason Cohen of WPEngine

A former officemate of mine, [Ace Subido](http://acesubido.com), shared a [video by Jason Cohen](https://vimeo.com/74338272) with me that further streamlined the process I want to take in bulding software businesses. The key takeaways from the talk (you must watch it though):

1. B2B (Business-to-business)
2. Non-real time
3. Products that can be "finished"
4. Products that fill-in an after-market need

# Automation on Many Levels

My ultimate goal is to automate and streamline the business-creation of these software business. A business that creates businesses. These businesses don't have to be large, multi-million dollar, press-release riddled, and with publicly traded shares - they can be small, solid businesses. [Many small, solid businesses](https://medium.com/entrepreneur-s-handbook/i-sat-down-with-a-millionaire-who-operates-10-businesses-while-sailing-around-the-world-with-his-338929c4e8c9). Then, I could sleep better at night knowing my son will more likely have money for college even when I can no longer get a paycheck.

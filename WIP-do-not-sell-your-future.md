# Do Not Sell Your Future

- Millenials & work-life balance?
- Saying time = money, but time > money
- money you can make back, time you cannot
- money you can pay someone, or design and automate something, where money becomes disentagled from time
- money. you can create something that generates money
- time. you cannot create something that gives you more time

- In Time - movie? What can we draw from this? This is the literal manifestation of money becoming a person's time. When you spent money, it meant lessening the life you will live.

- For most people, at least at some point in our lives, we have to sell our time and skills for money. This "rat race" is something which many of us want get out, but we do what we must do to survive.

- What I feel is not something we should accept is selling our future - our future time, and our future skills - for money today.

- As you grow older, your time, by virtue of supply, seems more valuable. This is why kids can spend whole weekends watching one movie a dozen times, but adults will likely feel like they're wasting their time. When you trade your future time for money today, you are trading much more than you realize.

- Your skills in the future are a multiplication of the skills you learn today. (How about justifying being overworked today to learn skills quickly?)

- Barring you outright
- Giving you so much work that it effectively bars you from doing anything else
